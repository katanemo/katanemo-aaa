  "description": "A Katanemo Service is a representation of the API surface area that developers want to enrich with enterprise-readiness capabilities (authentication, authorization, auditing - 3xA). Services are created using the familiar OpenAPI standard. OpenAPI neatly captures RESTful API definitions, resource schemas and establishes a great foundation for authorization and auditing. With familiar RESTful semantics developers (and customers) donâ€™t need to learn a new policy language, and get to enrich their API experience with rich 3xA capabilities without having to build and scale complex authorization and auditing engines",
