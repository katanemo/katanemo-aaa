  "description": "Roles establish a permission boundary that enables access to select API operations of a SaaS application. You don’t need to learn a new policy language to create Roles. Simply associate a list of OpenAPI-based operations (API paths and HTTP methods) with a Role, and assign Roles to Users or API Keys to enforce a strict authorization boundary. For example, the below UI shows how an API subscriber can define a Role for a set of API operations of an SaaS EHR application. Once the Role gets assigned to a User or an API Key, those principals are then limited to only those API operations associated with the Role. For instance the “Intern” Role below can only conduct the following API operations.",
