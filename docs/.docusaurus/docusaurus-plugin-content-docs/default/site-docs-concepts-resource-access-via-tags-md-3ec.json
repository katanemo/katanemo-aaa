  "description": "Tags consist of a key and value pair, and are part of a resourceâ€™s meta-data. Tags are used to ensure that API resources that belong to a set of principals are only accessible by those principals. Tags and Roles complement each other to create a powerful, yet simple authorization strategy. Roles capture what API operations can be performed by a principal, and Tags capture which resources are accessible to a set of principals. SaaS developers store Tags for resources created by their customers, and customers attach Tags to authorization principals to be used in authorization.",
