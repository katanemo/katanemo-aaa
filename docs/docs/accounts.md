# Accounts

To get started, visit [https://console.katanemo.com/sign-up](https://console.katanemo.com/sign-up) to get a Katanemo account. To create an account you must provide an email address. Katanemo will send you an email with a link to verify your domain. Follow the link received in email to complete the sign-up process, and you will be redirected to the Katanemo (service provider) console where you can create and manage your SaaS (API) services, distribute on-boarding links to your customers and subscribers, view access logs and invite additional members to operate on Katanemo.

_Note, Katanemo is built on Katanemo - we use the same engine for our on-boarding and authorization, as the one we offer to SaaS (API) developers. For more detailed information, please see our blog._
