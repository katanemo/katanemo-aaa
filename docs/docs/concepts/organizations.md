# Organizations


An organization is a container for SaaS customers to organize roles, manage users, machine (API) keys, SSO settings, and pull audit logs. An organization is created when a SaaS customer signs up to a SaaS application managed by Katanemo. Organizations also act as a thin wrapper to facilitate critical interactions between SaaS developers and SaaS customers. Developers can use Organizations in Katanemo to get detailed information about their customers and to set meta-data like subscription tiers, enabled/disable features, support prompts etc. 

For more information on Organizations, please visit the [Public APIs of Katanemo](/api#tag/organization).
