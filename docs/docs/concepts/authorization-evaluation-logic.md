# Authorization Evaluation Logic

The following sequence diagram describes how policy evaluation and authorization happens in Katanemo. Authorization is conducted by ARC, a decentralized, light-weight utility managed by Katanemo that neatly integrates via an SDK or at your API gateway layer. For more details, see How to [Integrate ARC (Authorization Runtime Client)](../how-to-guides/katanemo-sdk-integration)
