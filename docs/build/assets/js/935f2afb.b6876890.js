Katanemo supports Single sign-on (SSO) for OIDC and SAML compliant Identity providers like Okta, Ping, Auth0 via Connections. An enterprise IT administrator simply creates a Connection to their preferred Idp, and Katanemo uses the upstream Idp to initiate login and manages the token lifecycle before returning an authorization code to the application via its configured redirect_uri.

An organization is created when a SaaS customer signs up to a SaaS application managed by Katanemo. Organizations also act as a thin wrapper to facilitate critical interactions between SaaS developers and SaaS customers.

Tags are used to ensure that API resources that belong to a set of principals are only accessible by those principals. Tags and Roles complement each other to create a powerful, yet simple authorization strategy. Roles capture what API operations can be performed by a principal, and Tags capture which resources are accessible to a set of principals. SaaS developers store Tags for resources created by their customers, and customers attach Tags to authorization principals to be used in authorization.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"concepts/roles":{"id":"concepts/roles","title":"Roles","description":"Roles establish a permission boundary that enables access to select API operations of a SaaS application. You don\u2019t need to learn a new policy language to create Roles. Simply associate a list of OpenAPI-based operations (API paths and HTTP methods) with a Role, and assign Roles to Users or API Keys to enforce a strict authorization boundary. For example, the below UI shows how an API subscriber can define a Role for a set of API operations of an SaaS EHR application. Once the Role gets assigned to a User or an API Key, those principals are then limited to only those API operations associated with the Role. For instance the \u201cIntern\u201d Role below can only conduct the following API operations.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"concepts/scopes-oauth":{"id":"concepts/scopes-oauth","title":"Scopes (OAuth 2.0)","description":"Katanemo makes working with OAuth2.0 scopes super simple. As an API developer you simply define \u201cservice-defined\u201d Roles in your OpenAPI spec via Katanemo extensions. A \u201cservice-defined\u201d Role is simply a unique name mapped to a set of OpenAPI operations (resource paths and HTTP methods). 3rd party developers simply use \u201cservice-defined\u201d role names as scopes when initiating an OAuth2.0 flow via the /oauth/authorize endpoint for that specific OpenAPI Service instance. Katanemo\u2019s evaluation engine maps OAuth2.0 claims received in the JWT to \u201cservice-defined\u201d Roles via the claim name, and performs the appropriate authorization checks. Note, service-defined Roles can\u2019t be modified by API subscribers.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"concepts/service":{"id":"concepts/service","title":"Service","description":"A Katanemo Service is a representation of the API surface area that developers want to enrich with enterprise-readiness capabilities (authentication, authorization, auditing - 3xA).
