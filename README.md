<b>Welcome to Katanemo!</b>

The following repository contains: 

1. Our CLI experience for the Katanemo Cloud Service (A ridicously simple identity and fine-grained permissions system for API-first software comapnies)
2. A reference serverless EHR (Electronic Health Records) SaaS Service that demonstrates the full capabilities of Katanemo. A project that is inspired by https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-saas-factory-ref-solution-serverless-saas.
